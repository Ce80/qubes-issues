Creating a Qubes OS Issue
=========================

Thank you for contributing to the Qubes OS project! Before you create a new
issue, please take a moment to check whether your issue has already been
created.

 * Search through the existing [Qubes issues] by typing your key words in the
   **Filters** box. (Tip: Make sure you're searching both open *and closed*
   issues!)

 * Search through our [mailing lists] by visiting the Google Groups web
   interfaces for both [qubes-users] and [qubes-devel].

 * Please note that `qubes-issues` is not intended for personal, localized
   troubleshooting questions. Those questions are more likely to be answered in
   [qubes-users], which receives much more traffic. The answers will also be
   more likely to help others in the future!
