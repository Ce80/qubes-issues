Notes
-----
* **Feature Name**: An informal name or description for the feature.
* **Current Developers**: `(none)` means that no developer is currently assigned
  to this feature. Developers from the community are highly encouraged to claim
  these features and work on them! (Even if a feature currently has developers
  assigned to it, it's usually the case that help is still wanted.)
* **Status**: See the table below for the meaning of each status term.
* **Last Update**: For in-progress features, this denotes the last *substantive*
  development progress update (not merely the last time there was activity on
  the issue or thread).
* **See Also**: Related discussions, PoCs, or other links.
